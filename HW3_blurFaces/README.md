Blur and Swap Pictures - This app takes two pictures using the camera or gallery. The images can be modified via the swap action button, blur action button, and/or drawing on the image. Swap interchanges faces if each image detects a face. Blur rewrites each pixel by averaging the color with its surrounding neighbors. Draw paints on the image via touch interface.
